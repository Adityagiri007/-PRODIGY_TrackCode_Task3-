📊 Overview
The goal is to classify customers into two categories — Will Purchase or Will Not Purchase — using features such as age, income, gender, browsing history, etc.

This project includes:

Data preprocessing & EDA

Feature selection

Building and visualizing a Decision Tree

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and more

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic and behavioral data (e.g., age, income, gender, browsing behavior, previous purchases).

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
