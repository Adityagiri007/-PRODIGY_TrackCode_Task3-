🧠 Customer Purchase Prediction - Decision Tree Classifier
This repository contains a machine learning project that uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service, based on their demographic and behavioral data. This is part of my submission for PRODIGY_Trackcode Task 3.

📊 Overview
The goal is to classify customers into two categories — Will Purchase or Will Not Purchase — using features such as age, income, gender, browsing history, etc.

This project includes:

Data preprocessing & EDA

Feature selection

Building and visualizing a Decision Tree

Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic and behavioral data like:

Age

Gender

Income

Browsing behavior

Previous purchase history

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Adityagiri007/-PRODIGY_Trackcode_Task3-.git
cd -PRODIGY_Trackcode_Task3-
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the notebook or script:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
✅ Results
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test data.

📌 (Replace with actual metrics, confusion matrix plot, or classification report)

🔮 Future Work
Experiment with other classifiers (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Apply GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
